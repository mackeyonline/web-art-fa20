    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Part1</h2>
        <p>
        1) Create a web-based tool to dither images and/or video with generated qr codes. These qr codes may be functional or not, but regardless serve an aesthetic purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
        2) This is something I would be interested to use and develop beyond this class.
        </p>
        <p>
        3) Depending on the outcome of this project, I may include it in my portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
        4) This website is a good chance to experiment with code even if I donâ€™t initially succeed with realizing the vision I have for it.
        </p>
        <p>
        5) This website is one large project currently.
        </p>
        
    <h2>Part2</h2>
        <p>
        1) I want to make this project to further develop my interests in qr codes as a disruptive design element. This (somewhat recently) popularized scannable code form has much potential beyond its intended use, and I can learn to expand on these ideas with this project. I hope to at least learn to create a dithering tool or qr code generator.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        2) My primary concern is making something that focuses on my own experimentation with this medium, and making something that can actually work.

    <h2>Part3</h2>
        <p>
        1) *work in progress
        </p>
        
        <p>
        2) If I just sat down coding I could create the the basic structures to house this web-based tool, but I could not create it without more research and help.
